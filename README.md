# MB2 Project Submission - Land Cover Change Assessment and NDVI Time Series Analysis, Brazil
Including the scripts and file link for the MB2 Programming Project

**Description** <br>

This repository contains two scripts, one for the supervised classification of two Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 satellite scenes with subsequent Land Cover Change Assessment and a second script for further analysis of MODIS NDVI Raster Time Series (RTS) including statistical RTS analysis and breakpoint detection for a subset of the originial research area. <br>

All necessary data can be downloaded with the followink link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FA5ahEAsq9PF3vRc6qqJMWXw0S4dy6D0?usp=sharing

Please note that the pathway of the downloaded files has to be set as the working directory in R with the command `setwd()`.
